# Supply chain & data auditing

This repository containts an Ethereum DApp that demonstrates a Supply Chain flow between a Seller and Buyer. The user story is similar to any commonly used supply chain process. A Seller can add items to the inventory system stored in the blockchain. A Buyer can purchase such items from the inventory system. Additionally a Seller can mark an item as Shipped, and similarly a Buyer can mark an item as Received.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Please make sure you've already installed ganache-cli, Truffle and enabled MetaMask extension in your browser.

### Installing

> The starter code is written for **Solidity v0.4.24**. At the time of writing, the current Truffle v5 comes with Solidity v0.5 that requires function *mutability* and *visibility* to be specified (please refer to Solidity [documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.0/050-breaking-changes.html) for more details). To use this starter code, please run `npm i -g truffle@4.1.14` to install Truffle v4 with Solidity v0.4.24. 

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Clone this repository:

Change directory to project folder and install all requisite npm packages (as listed in ```package.json```):

```
npm install
```

Launch Ganache:

```
ganache-cli -m "spirit supply whale amount human item harsh scare congress discover talent hamster"
```

Migrate smart contracts to the locally running blockchain, ganache-cli:

```
truffle.cmd migrate
```

Test smart contracts:

```
truffle.cmd test
```

In a separate terminal window, launch the DApp:

```
npm run dev
```
